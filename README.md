# Overview

Protolang is a conlang (constructed language) generator, which seeks to generate fictional languages in a naturalistic manner. This generator is meant to act as a starting point for writers and worldbuilders for creating the grammatical structure, sound, and vocabulary of a language.
Protolang creates a base language for people to build upon with nuance and cultural features specific to the use-case that would be more difficult to automatically generate.
