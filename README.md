# Overview

Protolang is a conlang (constructed language) generator made for writers and worldbuilders. With a few clicks, you can generate the sounds, grammar, and core vocabulary of a new language! 

## How To Use

Currently, Protolang is accessible as a terminal app. 

Run `julia main.jl` from within the file. You will be prompted with:
```
Commands:
r, run, reload - create and display language
l, load <seed> - load language with seed (ex. load 72548917)
q, quit, exit - exit
```

Current output consists of a phoneme inventory and grammar overview. 

### Under Construction:

- Exporting to files (save function)
- Case/Declensions tables, grammar formatting, and anglicized examples
- Lexicon generation

### Dependencies

 The [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language is required to run Protolang.
