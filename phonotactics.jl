	# Onsets and codas tend to be similar in max length
	# Greater than 5 is very rare
	# CCCVCCCC strengths
	# CVC is most common, CV is required

	# longer mid-words are much less likely; CCVCC usually has CC midword, or C
	# This does create a lack of sound bias and a very uniform layout (no likely e or m or something). Allow this at first but not later â€” Probably in the Lexeme function and not here.
	# USE SET FOR WORD-INITIAL ETC -- no need, it constructs itself organizedly
